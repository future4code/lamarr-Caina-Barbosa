    <h1 id="bio-h1">Hey there!</h1>
    <p id="bio-p">If you are here, you must be asking yourself: who's Cainã Perotti Barbosa? Well, for as long as I can remember, I've always been a tech enthusiast. When I was just a kid, instead of giving me a Nintendo 64 for Christmas, my mother bought me a computer as, in her words, "I could use it to learn, instead of just playing games". 
    She didn't even knew how on point she was! My first interest was learning how to emulate those games my friends could play on their videogames, and from there, it spanned to all things tech-related. 
    At very young age, I was already working in my father's newspaper, diagrammatizing its' publications, processing photos for better printing, and of course, troubleshooting everyone's issues! Little did I know that I was building precious hard and soft skills! 
    When it came to college, surprisingly, I picked a different route, and ended up graduating in Social Sciences. It was only due to the pandemic, that, while my course was stalled, I joined Trilogy and discovered a brand new carrer waiting for me, with loads of space to grow. On Trilogy, I'm in constant development, supporting many products and joining new projects, as per the company's expansion politics. <a href="projects.html" style=""> Let's learn more about those projects?</a>
